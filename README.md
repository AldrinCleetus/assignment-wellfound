# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Methods used to solve the problem

I divided the project into multiple components, including a Navbar with a button and a Card component with multiple parameters such as name, email, and picture. I then integrated these components together and utilized the fetch() method to retrieve the data. To display the data, I looped over each object in the data array and generated a corresponding Card component with its respective values. I encapsulated this logic into a function that is triggered only when the Navbar button is pressed.
